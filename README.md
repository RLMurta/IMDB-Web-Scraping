## Instructions
   ## Scrapping
   In order to run the scrapping algorithm firstly check if the classes are updated with the IMDB webpage as they tend to change codes in it, the most likely to be changed have a line of commentary saying that they could change on the line before it. After that run `python3 Scrapping.py` on the terminal, which after some time will result in a file named `data.json`.

   ## Interface
   In order to run the Interface run `python3 main.py` on the terminal.

## OBS.
   Do not try to scroll with your mouse or touchpad, use the lateral bar of the program as for some unknow reason it seems as the scrolling function is faulty.
